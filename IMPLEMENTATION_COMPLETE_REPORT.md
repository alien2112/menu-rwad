### **Performance Improvements**:

1. **Database Queries**: Reduced from O(n) individual queries to O(1) batch operations
2. **Pagination**: Server-side pagination prevents memory issues with large datasets
3. **Caching**: Optimized query patterns with lean() and proper indexing
4. **WebSocket**: Real-time updates without polling overhead
5. **Batch Operations**: Bulk updates instead of individual saves

### **Scalability Enhancements**:

1. **Pagination**: All major endpoints now support pagination
2. **Batch Processing**: Inventory consumption uses batch operations
3. **Query Optimization**: Reduced database load with efficient queries
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket eliminates polling requirements
5. **Admin Tools**: Bulk operations for managing large datasets
