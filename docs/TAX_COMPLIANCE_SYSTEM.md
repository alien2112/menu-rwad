## Default Configuration (Saudi Arabia)

```javascript
{
  enableTaxHandling: true,
  taxType: "VAT",
  vatRate: 15,
  includeTaxInPrice: true,
  displayTaxBreakdown: true,
  generateTaxReports: true,
  taxNumber: null,
  complianceMode: "Saudi ZATCA"
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Tax Settings
- `GET /api/tax-settings` - Retrieve current tax settings
- `PUT /api/tax-settings` - Update tax settings
- `POST /api/tax-settings` - Create initial tax settings

### Tax Reports
- `GET /api/tax-reports?period=month` - Generate tax reports
  - Parameters: `period` (day/week/month/year), `startDate`, `endDate`

## Database Schema

### TaxSettings Collection
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  enableTaxHandling: Boolean,
  taxType: String, // 'VAT' | 'GST' | 'SALES_TAX' | 'CUSTOM'
  vatRate: Number, // 0-100
  includeTaxInPrice: Boolean,
  displayTaxBreakdown: Boolean,
  generateTaxReports: Boolean,
  taxNumber: String | null,
  complianceMode: String, // 'Saudi ZATCA' | 'UAE FTA' | 'GCC' | 'CUSTOM'
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Order Tax Information
```javascript
{
  // ... existing order fields
  taxInfo: {
    subtotal: Number,
    taxRate: Number,
    taxAmount: Number,
    includeTaxInPrice: Boolean
  }
}
```

## Tax Calculation Logic

### Tax Included in Price (Saudi Default)
```javascript
const subtotal = totalPrice / (1 + vatRate / 100);
const taxAmount = totalPrice - subtotal;
```

### Tax Added to Price
```javascript
const taxAmount = subtotal * (vatRate / 100);
const totalPrice = subtotal + taxAmount;
```

## Saudi ZATCA Compliance

### Tax Number Validation
- Format: 15 digits starting with '3'
- Regex: `/^3\d{14}$/`
- Example: `312345678901234`

### Required Information
- Business tax registration number
- VAT rate (15% standard)
- Tax-inclusive pricing
- Detailed tax breakdowns on receipts

## Frontend Integration

### useTaxSettings Hook
```javascript
const { 
  settings, 
  calculateTax, 
  formatPriceWithTax, 
  getTaxBreakdown 
} = useTaxSettings();
```

### Price Display
```javascript
// Automatic tax-aware pricing
const displayPrice = formatPriceWithTax(originalPrice);
// Result: "86.96 ÿ±.ÿ≥ + 13.04 ÿ±.ÿ≥ ÿ∂ÿ±Ÿäÿ®ÿ©" or "100.00 ÿ±.ÿ≥"
```
